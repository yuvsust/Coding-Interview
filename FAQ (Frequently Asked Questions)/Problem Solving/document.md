# Linked List
### 1. Insert a new element in the linked list at the *begining / middle / end* position.
### 2. Delete an element from the linked list. From *begining / middle / end* position.
### 3. What are the complexity of these operations => (Insertion, Deletion, Searching, Accessing).
### 4. Insert a node to its correct sorted position in a sorted linked list.
### 5. Sort linked list in increasing order.
### 6. Remove duplicates from a sorted linked list in a single traversal.
### 7. Merge two sorted linked lists into one. The merged linked list must also be sorted.
### 8. Intersection of two sorted linked lists.
### 9. Reverse a linked List â€” (Iterative Solution & Recursive Solution) 
### 10. Reverse every group of `k` nodes in a linked list.  
### 11. Detect cycle in a linked list
### 12. Check if a linked list is palindrome or not.

# Array, Grid and More
### 1. Given an array and a target. Return different indices of two numbers such that they add up to target. [ Array may not be sorted. Make your solution run in linear time ]
### 2. Given an array of integers (positive and negative) find the largest continuous sum.
### 3. Given a matrix of integers and coordinates of a rectangular region ( top left and bottom right coordinates ) within the matrix, find the sum of numbers falling inside the rectangle. What optimization will you apply if you are given multiple rectangular regions in terms of test case ( test_case <= 10^5) ?
### 4. There is an array of non-negative integers. A second array is formed by shuffling the elements of the first array and deleting a random element. Given these two arrays, find which element is missing in the second array. `Possible solutions. sorting: O(NlogN) time, hashing: O(N) time + O(N) space, sum_both_array: O(N) time + O(1) space (but it could overflow), xor: O(N) time + O(1) space`
### 5. Given a _sorted_ array. Remove duplicates from the array. `Possible solutions. convert_into_SET_then_again_into_List_and_sort: O(NlogN) time + O(N) space, add_unique_values_to_another_list: O(N) time + O(N) space, use_same_list_and_two_pointers_then_return_the_resultant_subarray: O(N) time + O(1) space`
